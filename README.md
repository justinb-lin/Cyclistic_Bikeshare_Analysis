# Project Background
Cyclistic, launched in 2016, is a hypothetical bike-sharing company created for the purposes of this capstone project. While the company itself does not exist, the analysis is grounded in real-world data from the Divvy bike-share program in Chicago.

The project explores the behavioral differences between casual riders—those who purchase single or daily passes—and annual members, with the goal of uncovering insights that can inform strategies to drive membership growth. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have identified that annual members generate greater long-term value compared to casual riders, positioning casual users as a strategic target for conversion, an area that will serve as the primary focus of this study.

This project intends to uncover key insights and trends that will assist the marketing team by identifying critical aspects to prioritize in potential marketing strategies.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Evaluation of consumer behavior trends throughout the year, focusing on ride volume, seasonal usage, and duration of trips of casual riders and members.
  
- **Product/Service Usage Analysis:** Analysis of ride patterns for casual riders versus members, emphasizing product preference.
  
- **Time-of-Day and Day-of-Week Patterns:** Assessment of datetime riding patterns, focusing on time-of-day and weekday vs. weekend usage.
